            <h1>A world class museum</h1>
            <p>Maroy Science Museum is a modern and interactive science museum. This project started back in 2011 and is now opening in december 2021.
                At this museum we want our visitors to have an enjoyable time while also learning.
                Our goal is to become a museum at an international level. We invite people in all age categories, but our main target audience is children and young people
                who are in their learning years.
                
                Here at Maroy Science Museum we are committed to making science accessible to all.
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries
                 and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                 This is why we have many different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. 
                 Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life.
